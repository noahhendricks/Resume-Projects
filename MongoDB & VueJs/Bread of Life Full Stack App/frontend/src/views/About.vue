<p>
Bread of Life began in 1992 by serving 500 hot meals a day to homeless individuals in midtown Houston. 
With the help of a close partnership with Beyonce and Tina Knowles-Lawson, 
they have coordinated numerous anti-hunger initiatives and provided emergency support during natural disasters, 
in addition to their outreach to the homeless. They need data tracking and reporting to support their activities in homeless outreach, anti-hunger campaigns, 
and health outcomes in the communities served.
</p>

<p>
The web application will help to build a basic data platform for a more efficient and data driven approach to their services.

<h4>
  Application Guidelines
</h4>
<p> (1) </p>
<p>
They need a page that provides intake information on individuals served at certain distribution events/services. Details can be found in Appendix B. 
IMPORTANT: There needs to be a page where a project manager can update the list of events/services offered. 
The list of possible distribution events/services has to come from entries in the DB and is not fixed for the intake forms. 
Events should have a type, location and date stored for them. The form should only list the 3 most current events/services.
</p><br>

<p> (2) </p>

<p>
Next, there needs to be a page that allows the project managers to know how many times and in what ways each individual has accessed their services. 
There should be a table that shows the individualâ€™s history and gives the total.
</p><br>

<p> (3) </p>

<p>
Finally, there needs to be the page that a supervisor can use to see the total activities by event (such as a single day food distribution) 
or by place of residence (zip code) of the people served. 
There should also be at least one summary graph to show individual use patterns or patterns across the population of users.
