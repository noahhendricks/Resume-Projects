Exercise Part D

1. Add the follwoing employees to any collection:
> db.Safety.insert({
...     employeeid: 1187,
...     name: "John Steight",
...     salary: 75000
... })
WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
> db.Safety.insert({
...     employeeid: 2455,
...     name: "Syed",

...     employeeid: 24113,
...     name: "Wright John",
...     salary: 65000
... });
WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })

2. Find 2 documents using the field name employeeid

Exercise Part E
We are going to use real world data: http://nicholasjohnson.com/mongo/datasets/stocks.json

First, get get the file onto your computer. Your task is to import that data into a new collection called stocks.

You need to install the MongoDB Tools https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/installation/installation/ if you have not done so already in order to be able to use the mongoimport command in a terminal.

Use the following command in a terminal:
mongoimport --db employees --collection stocks --file stocks.json
Then execute the following tasks and report code and output:

1. Find all stocks with Average Volume less than 100
> use employees
switched to db employees
> db.stocks.find({
...     "Average Volume": {
...         $lt: 100
...     }
... })
Output:
