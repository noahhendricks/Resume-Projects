CIS 4339 - 14075 Homework 1, Fall 2021
Mongo DB Exercises (Individual assignment)
This is designed as tutorial and exercise model assignment. Each exercise is to be solved and reported. Each exercise builds on the last, so itâ€™s best to work through these exercises in order.

Tutorial is designed for both Mongo Shell and VS Code commands.

IMPORTANT
Do not mix and match mongo shell and VS Code commands

Run VS Code script as a whole, as it seems there is some bug when running single line commands.
