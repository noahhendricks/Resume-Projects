README Files contain the following:
1. What the project does?
2. Why the project is useful?
3. How users can get started with the project?
4. Where users can get help with your project?
5. Who maintains and contributes to the project?

Homework1 Folder contains assigned ZyLabs from Chapters 1-5 as well as Coding Problem 1.

Coding Problem 1 :

1. Calculates the age of person based on current date and the birthday of the user and outputs it in the command prompt.
2. It allows the user to fihure out ages and birthdays of others.
3. Just  the current date by month, day, and year.
   Then Prompt the user to enter the birthday by month, day, and year.
4. Users can contact the maintainer or the contributer(s) to get help with the project.
5. I, Noah Hendricks, maintains and contributes to the project as well as Professor Ratner and his TA.

Homework2 Folder contains assigned ZyLabs from Chapters 6-9 as well as Coding Problem 2 Parts a,b,c.

Coding Problem 2:

1. Part A: It's a program that reads dates from input, one date per line. Each date's format must be as follows: March 1, 1990. Any date not following that format is incorrect and            should be ignored. It outputs each correct date as: 3/1/1990.

   Part B: It's a modified program from Part A that reads all dates from an input file “inputDates.txt” and outputs only the correct formatted dates.
   
   Part C: It's a program that parses all dates from the input file “inputDates.txt”, and it writes out the correct ones into an output file called: “parsedDates.txt”.
   
2. Part A: The project is useful because it converts Dates from a letter/ number format mix to a professional integer format.

   Part B: The project is useful because it reads all input dates from an input file.
   
   Part C: The project is useful because it parses all dates from an input file and writes them out correctly in an output file.
   
3. Part A: Users can get started with the project by typing in a date in the correct format in the command prompt.

   Part B: Users can get started with the project by typing in the location of the the text file in the user command prompt.
   
   Part C: Users can get started with the project by typing in the location of the the text file in the user command prompt and searching for the new output file called "parsedDates".
   
4. Users can contact the maintainer or the contributer(s) to get help with the project.
5. I, Noah Hendricks, maintains and contributes to the project as well as Professor Ratner and his TA.
