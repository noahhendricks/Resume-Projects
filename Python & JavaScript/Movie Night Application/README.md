Movie Application that has a prominent backend code that uses all CRUD functionality along with MySQL as the database to store entities and data.
We use PostMan to test our data to make sure there are no errors and evrything can run.
This application allows the user to type in a certain amount of friends and then that friend's corresponding top ten favorite movies.
And then after all the friends are in the database the user will procedd to select which friends are participating in the movie night.
Finally the program will generate a random movie from the pool of friend's movies that are selected to participate in the movie night.

Frontend code is underdeveloped and can only read and add.
