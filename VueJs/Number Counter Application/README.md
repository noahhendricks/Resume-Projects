This is a counter html page that allows render capability through a number counter. The user is able to increment, decrement, and reset the count. Also, there is a text output that will tell the user if their number inputted is even or odd. This app is ran through VUE JS and has 2 different ways of how the files are setup within the VS Code environment. One way is inserting the HTML file within the CLI. And the other way is creating a single file component within the app.
